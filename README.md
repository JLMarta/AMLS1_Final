# AMLS1_Final
This Repository is used for assessment of AMLS1
This project requires external libraries: os, numpy, keras, cv2, dlib, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas and sklearn
All essential functions are included in functions.py from data collection, feature extraction, hyper-parameter tuning to model.
Main.py includes models for each task, by executing main.py, 4 test accuracies will be generated. However, if you wish to see
how hyper-parameters are tuned, then you need to run Hyper_Paramter_Tune function separately and I don't suggest you to do it
as it takes long time to run cross-validation.
Importantly!!! This code will takes 10 mins for task A and probably 40 mins for task B as it contains larger dataset and complex model.
!!! Importantly A1,A2,B1,B2 and Dataset are all empty, I just followed the structure you given in the assessment notes.
Useful files are functions.py, main.py and shape.dat
